# Personal-Website

I have created a website which would be regularly updated.
The main purpose is to try and test new things into this website to make it look more beautiful.
It would act as a great testing ground for newcomers looking to get themselves introduced into the world of open source.
Newcomers can come and contribute to this website and get their hands dirty on it. It would help them to get acquainted with the workflow followed in any open source project.
It is currently built entirely using HTML and CSS.
Further technologies like bootstrap, javascript, jQuery and reactjs would be added to it to make it more functional and interactive.
Any addition or changes to it are very much appreciated! 


You are welcome to introduce even very basic changes to it which could be as small as solving some typos in the README.md
 or improving its content.
You can also create new issues and start working on it.
It would be beneficial for someone who is not yet introduced to using git and GitHub. If you have solved some issues earlier try to leave it for someone who is entirely a beginner.
Thanks!
